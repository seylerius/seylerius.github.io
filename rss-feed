Obviously enough to those who&apos;ve checked, my site&apos;s been down for a while, due to my dissatisfaction with how I&apos;d set it up and lack of time to fix it. Equally obviously, this state has changed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I&apos;ve rebuilt the site using &lt;a href=&quot;http://nakkaya.com/static.html&quot;&gt;Nakkaya&apos;s static&lt;/a&gt;, a Clojure-based static site generator. I&apos;m going to be featuring writeups more than blog posts, and have thus chosen a tool that supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org&quot;&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt;, an easily learned text markup that can double as a code notebook, among many other things. This allows me to easily embed the code and results I use in my analysis directly into my writeups. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Disqus comments are still at the bottom of posts, and I welcome your feedback about the change, as well as anything I share. 
&lt;/p&gt;
